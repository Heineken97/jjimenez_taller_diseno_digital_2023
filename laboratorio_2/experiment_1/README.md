# BCD SystemVerilog

1. Design a decoder that allows converting a 4-bit binary number to its
respective representation in BCD (binary-coded decimal), using a
behavioral modeling approach in SystemVerilog.

1. Perform a testbench in SystemVerilog that shows the operation of
the decoder in a simple way. Show the test results for at least 8 different
values.

1. Implement the decoder in the FPGA. Use the switches (starting at zero) as
input and a 7-segment display to visualize the operation of the decoder.
